Problem Statement
Booking appointments through certain web portals can be tedious and time-consuming due to high demand and limited availability. Manually refreshing the page and checking for open slots can be inefficient and prone to human error. This script aims to solve this problem by:

Automating the process of navigating to the appointment page.
Simulating human-like behavior to avoid detection as a bot.
Continuously checking for available appointment slots.
Notifying the user when an appointment is found.
Logging each attempt, whether successful or not, for tracking purposes.
