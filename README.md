# Analysis-and-Optimization-of-Appointment-Scheduling-from-Government

**Problem Statement**
Booking appointments through certain web portals, for example, ServicePortal Berlin(https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistung/120686/), can be tedious and time-consuming due to high demand and limited availability. Manually refreshing the page and checking for open slots can be inefficient and prone to human error. This script aims to solve this problem by:

**Completed Solutions**
1. **Automated Navigation**: Automatically navigates to the appointment page.
2. **Human-like Behavior**: Simulates human actions to avoid detection as a bot.
3. **Continuous Monitoring**: Continuously checks for available appointment slots.
4. **User Notification**: Notifies the user when an appointment slot becomes available.
5. **Attempt Logging**: Logs each attempt, whether successful or not, for tracking purposes.

   
**Ongoing Solutions**
1. **Database Tracking**: Continues to store tracking information in a database.
2. **Data Analysis**: Analyzes stored data to identify trends and patterns.
3. **Success Rate Analysis**: Provides success rates for logins in each time slot.
4. **Optimal Timing Recommendations**: Suggests best times to log in for increased chances of success.
